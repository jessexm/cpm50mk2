#
#       CP/M logical disk drives are defined using the
#       options given below, where the sequence is:
#
#       disks   n
#       diskdef parameter-list-0
#       diskdef parameter-list-1
#       ...
#       diskdef parameter-list-n
#       endef
#
#       where n is the number of logical disk drives attached
#       to the CP/M system, and parameter-list-i defines the
#       characteristics of the ith drive (i=0,1,...,n-1)
#
#       each parameter-list-i takes the form
#               dn,fsc,lsc,[skf],bls,dks,dir,cks,ofs,[0]
#       where
#       dn      is the disk number 0,1,...,n-1
#       fsc     is the first sector number (usually 0 or 1)
#       lsc     is the last sector number on a track
#       skf     is optional "skew factor" for sector translate
#       bls     is the data block size (1024,2048,...,16384)
#       dks     is the disk size in bls increments (word)
#       dir     is the number of directory elements (word)
#       cks     is the number of dir elements to checksum
#       ofs     is the number of tracks to skip (word)
#       [0]     is an optional 0 which forces 16K/directory entry
#
#       for convenience, the form
#               dn,dm
#       defines disk dn as having the same characteristics as
#       a previously defined disk dm.
#
#       a standard four drive CP/M system is defined by
#               disks   4
#               diskdef 0,1,26,6,1024,243,64,64,2
